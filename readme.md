# Image File Organizer

This is a Python script that allows you to move all image/video files from one folder to another.  It uses multithreading and some improvements to speed up the process.

It will move the files into a folder that correlate with the year it was taken.  It bases that year on a date stamp in the file name.

This is used to organize pictures from a Google Photos backup from Take out.
